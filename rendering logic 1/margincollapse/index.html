            <h1>Margin Collapse</h1>
            <h1>Rule 1:Only vertical margins collapse </h1>
            <div>
                <p class="margin1">Paragraph one with 24px margin top and bottom</p>
                <p class="margin1">Paragraph two with 24px margin top and bottom</p>
            </div>
            <p>Instead of these 2 paragraphs having 48px inbetween them they only have 24 because
                of margin collapse (I can check with the inspector)
            </p>
            <h1>Rule2:Only adjacent elements collapse</h1>
            <div>
                <p class="margin1">Paragraph one with 24px margin top and bottom</p>
                <br>
                <p class="margin1">Paragraph two with 24px margin top and bottom</p>
            </div>
            <p>We put a "br" element between these 2 paragraphs and that cancels out the collapse as you can see there's more space between the same 2 paragraphs in this example compared to the one above</p>
            <h1>Rule 3:The bigger margin wins</h1>
            <div>
                <p class="margin1">Paragraph one with 24px margin top and bottom</p>
                <p class="margin2">Paragraph two with 72px margin top and bottom</p>
            </div>
            <p>there will be 72px between these two elements because the bottom element has a margin of 72 so that will cancel out the 24 and collapse</p>
