        <h1>If we inspect the P we will see that it not only takes up the 150px
            that the section takes up but it also 36 more pixels for the margin
            and the border. This is because we have no box sizing option on so if
            a margin and border are set and width is at 100% it can have more width than
            it's parent element which we don't want
        </h1>
        <h2>Down below we will make another section with the same properties 
            but we will add box sizing border box and it will make the content with border,
            padding fit inside of the containter</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Hello World</h3>
        </section>
        <h2>If we inspect the H3 here we will see the width of it is 150 instead of 186 like the P above</h2>
