    <h1>Padding is simply the space between the content(h1,p,etc) and the border</h1>
    <h1>Margin is meant to increase the distance between siblings. It is not meant to increase the gap between a child and its parent's bounding box; that's what padding is for.</h1>
    <section class="section1">
        <p>This element has a 20px padding</p>
    </section>
    <section class="section2">
        <p>This element has a 40px padding and you can see there is double the space 
            between the content and border in this element as opposed to the element above</p>
    </section>
